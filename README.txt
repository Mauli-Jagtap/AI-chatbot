# AI Chatbot with Transformers

This repository showcases an AI-powered chatbot developed using Hugging Face's transformers library. The project demonstrates the use of pre-trained transformer models to create an intelligent conversational agent.

# Key Features:

- Built with Hugging Face Transformers, utilizing the DialoGPT pre-trained model.
- Provides intelligent responses to user inputs, mimicking natural conversation.
- Includes fallback error handling for unsupported inputs.
- Simple Python implementation designed to showcase the potential of NLP-powered AI chatbots.

# Next Steps:
- Enhancements:
  - Fine-tune the chatbot on custom datasets for specialized domains.
  - Expand functionality to include advanced NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or entity recognition.
- Integration:
  - Develop a web or mobile interface using Flask or FastAPI.
  - Deploy the chatbot on platforms like Telegram or Slack.

# Technologies Used:
- Python: Primary language for chatbot development.
- Hugging Face Transformers: Library for leveraging pre-trained models.
- DialoGPT: Pre-trained conversational model from Hugging Face.
- PyTorch: Backend framework used by the transformers library.
